# Schedule
## Quick Overview
The Employee Schedule Interface is a tool that employers can use to automate the creation of a week's schedule. Employees can log in and change what days they are available to work (such as saying they can't work Sundays), as well as take days off. They can also change how many days that they prefer to work a week, and set a minimum number of shifts as well as a maximum. Employers can change the priority of certain employees, and change what types of shifts they are allowed to work.
